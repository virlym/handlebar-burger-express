  ## **Description**
  
  A burger logger utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM following the MVC design pattern. Users can input the names of burgers they'd like to eat or have eaten. Each burger name will have two buttons attached to it. One will be either 'Just eat it' or 'make another', which will allow the burger to swap between the left and right sides. And another button to remove the burger from the list completely. The burgers are stored in a database so the information will persist even on a different device.
